### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alejandro Prada.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and technology. The majority of my professional career
has been linked to R&D projects. First, as a Software Engineer and later as a Security Engineer in H2020
projects, the EU funding programme. Besides the R&D, I've also been involved in innovation projects related
to fraud detection with customers of the insurance industry and the financial sector.

On this repository, I occasionally share python prototypes and other stuff related to Threat Intelligence, Malware Analysis and DFIR.
